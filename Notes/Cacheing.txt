Caching
    - Types:
        - Client side: Browser
        - Edge: AWS CloudFront
        - Server side:
        - Database:
            Load types:
            - Inline: Service manages r/w to db: DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator)
            - Side loaded: Elasticache
                - Lazy-side loading: App writes to DB only
                - Write through: App writes to both DB and Cache

    - ElastiCache (Server and DB side):
        * Managed Service
        * Redis/Memcached
        * Backends can be RDS/DynamoDB/any_db
        * Workflow:
            1) App trys cache (misses)
            2) App trys db (hits)
            3) App write to cache server
